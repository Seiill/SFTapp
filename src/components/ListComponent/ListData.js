    'The general duty clause (section 5(a)(1) of the OSH Act): Requires each employer to “furnish…a place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees.” It obligates employers to take additional steps toward safety if the well-being of employees is in jeopardy regardless if there is a specific standard or not. The additional steps toward safety may involve training.',

For example, a new chemical that is introduced may require additional Hazard Communication and new PPE training or a new confined space may require additional confined space training, or a new job duty may require additional safety training on any of the topics listed above.',
